## Name: Packets Primer
#### Points: 100
#### Description: Download the packet capture file and use packet analysis software to find the flag.
#### Files: `network-dump.flag.pcap`

We receive a packet-capture file, and the obvious first step would be to open the file in Wireshark to analyse the contents.
When inspecting the packets, there are only a couple of TCP and ARP packets. Most interesting would be the TCP packets, and therefore we can 
right-click any of them, and choose `follow TCP stream`. Doing this displays the flag right away ðŸš©:

  ```
  
  Alternatively, we could also use the `strings` command, since the capture file is so small:
  
  ```console
  
  â”Œâ”€â”€(gagrã‰¿desktop)-[/pico/picoCTF2022/forensics/packets-primer]
  â””â”€$ strings network-dump.flag.pcap
