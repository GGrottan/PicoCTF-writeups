## Name: Lookey Here
#### Points: 100
#### Description: Attackers have hidden information in a very large mass of data in the past, maybe they are still doing it.
#### Files: `anthem.flag.txt`

We receive a text file with a lot of text. There might be many ways to find potential hidden information in such files, and one of these methods
is to use the `strings` and `grep` commands to look for specific text. I've previously made a 
[custom script](https://github.com/GGrottan/plainflag-finder) that looks for several flag-indicators in these types
of files. In short, this script automates the use of `strings` and `grep` based on a list of keywords associated with flags, and prints the results to the console.

Running the [plainflag-finder](https://github.com/GGrottan/plainflag-finder) script outputs the flag ðŸš©:
