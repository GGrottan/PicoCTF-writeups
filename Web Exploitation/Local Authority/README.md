#### Description: Can you get the flag? Go to this website and see what you can discover 
#### Files: None

We are given a website where we need to log in. Above the login form, the following information is given: `Only letters and numbers allowed for username and password.`.
Since we are only allowed numbers and letters, we are most likely not required to perform any injection attack. 

Instead, we can send some dummy data and inspect what files are called when we submit the form.
Looking in the `Network` tab in the developer tools, we can see that a `GET` request is performed for a file named `secure.js` when we try to log in. 
Inspecting this file reveals the following:

```javascript
function checkPassword(username, password)
{
  if( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )
  {
    return true;
  }
  else
  {
    return false;
  }
}

```

Using these credentials, we are presented with the flag ðŸš©:
