We are presented a pretty well-crafted website for yoga. As per the description and challenge name, we should probably start looking at the website source
for any clues.

Checking the console, there are no apparent messages or warnings that are out of place, except for some jquery and import warnings and errors (although this might vary depending on the type of browser you are using).

Inspecting the debugger, we can find a comment in the index.html file: `The flag is not here but keep digging :)`.
Further inspecting the javascript-files:

`custom.js`: there is some form validation for the contact form. This might be worth investigating if nothing else turns up. Some function calls also seem to be undefined, which might be interesting.
The rest of the javascript files are standard or library specific imports that aren't created by the developer. I checked the files for any comments, but there
didn't seem to be any. 

Looking at the CSS files, there are mostly default imports or library-specific files, however, one file is created by the developer: `style.css`.
Looking at this file, the flag is placed as a comment above the style for the banner that is at the top of the webpage ðŸš©:

  <summary>Flag [Spoiler]</summary>

  ```css

  /** banner_main picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_227d64bd} **/
   .carousel-indicators li {
       width: 20px;
       height: 20px;
       border-radius: 11px;
       background-color: #070000;
  }

  ```
