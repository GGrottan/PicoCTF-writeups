We receive a `.txt` file, which contains the following ciphertext:

```console

Pico's a CTFFFFFFF

```

My initial reaction was that the "lyrics" look a bit like obfuscated assembly, with the "put", "shout" and "into"
words frequently being used. After many failed attempts at trying to google my way to what this could be, I checked the hint for the task:

`Do you think you can master rockstar?`

It turns out that there is a funny programming language called [Rockstar](https://codewithrockstar.com/docs), where code is converted into
song lyrics! Looking at the documentation and examples, this looks very similar to the lyrics in our file.

I also found a neat [Python compiler](https://github.com/yyyyyyyan/rockstar-py) for Rockstar code, however, I couldn't
manage to get it to work, as I kept getting syntax error for one of the variables in the code.

Luckily, the official rockstar webpage also has a [compiler](https://codewithrockstar.com/online) that lets me run the script!

The output of `lyrics.txt` looks like the following:

```bash
114
114
114
111
99
107
110
114
110
48
49
49
51
114
```
With numbers such as these, where there are 3-digit and 2-digit numbers above 32, I suspected that
they are ascii codes. I created a small Python script that converts the ascii values to letters:

```python
input_value = input('input some ascii: ')

output = ''

for n in input_value.split(' '):

    output += chr(int(n))


print('picoCTF{'+ output + '}')
```

Feeding our script with the output of the `lyrics.txt` file gives us the flag ðŸš©:

```console 
gagr@ubntu:~/Documents/pico/General_skills/mus1c$ python3 ascii.py 
input some ascii: 114 114 114 111 99 107 110 114 110 48 49 49 51 114
picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}
```
