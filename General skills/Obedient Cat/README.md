#### Name: Obedient cat
#### Category: General skills
#### Description: This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear").
#### Points: 5

This is the very first CTF task, and is more of an introduction to using the flags rather than a challenge,
but I've chosen to include it for the sake of consistency :triangular_flag_on_post:

The "challenge" provides us with a file called _flag_, and checking the type with the `type` command, we can see that
it contains ASCII text:

Using the `cat` command (as implied by the name of the challenge), we can read the contents of the file, and retrieve the flag:

Easy Peasy! :trophy:
