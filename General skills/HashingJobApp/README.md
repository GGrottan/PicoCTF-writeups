For this challenge, we receive a netcat connection. Executing the given connection prompts us to provide an MD5 hash of a short sentence:

```console

â”Œâ”€â”€(gagrã‰¿desktop)-[/picomini2022/hashingjobapp]
â””â”€$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 65352
Please md5 hash the text between quotes, excluding the quotes: 'Muhammad Ali'
Answer:

```

This task is fairly trivial due to all of the convertion tools one can find online, however, it's always good practice to make our own converter.
Using a built-in Python library called `hashlib`, we can easily generate the MD5 hash for a given string:

```python

import hashlib

sentence = input('string to generate hash for: ')

res = hashlib.md5(sentence.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

print(res)

```

In order to beat the challenge, we have to generate three different hashes for three different strings - all of them MD5.
This is simply a matter of copy-pasting strings. After the third conversion, we are given the flag ðŸš©:
