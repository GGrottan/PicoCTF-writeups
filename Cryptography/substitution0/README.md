## Name: substitution0
#### Points: 100
#### Description: A message has come in but it seems to be all scrambled. Luckily it seems to have the key at the beginning. Can you crack this substitution cipher? 
#### Files: `message.txt`

We receive a text file containing the following information:

We receive a scrambled text, and it is pretty clear that the flag is at the very bottom, as we can see that any other characters apart from letters
still have their original form. This means that we already have parts of the flag ready. Furthermore, these kinds of ciphers are also weak to statistical analysis. 
This means that even though the letters are substituted, they still retain their original statistical form. 

For example, we can see that `p` is used a lot by itself in-between words, meaning that it's the enciphered form of the letter `a`. 
This theory is also strengthened by the fact that we are given a key at the top. This looks to be a permutation of the alphabet, and we can also see that 
the letter `P` is placed where `A` should be. Based on these observations, we can make use of the given key:

| Permutation | Alphabet  |
|------------|---|
| Ciphertext  | PAQZTNDSRYWFEXGJKCVLBUHOMI|
| Plaintext  |  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ |

Also knowing that every flag starts with `picoCTF`, we can double check that our hypothesis is correct. Using the table above, we can see
that `j --> p, r --> i, q --> c, g --> o`! If we are really interested in what the enciphered text says, we could make a script that re-substitutes 
the letters for us, but the flag contains a lot of numbers and re-use of the same letters, and so it's just easier to decipher it manually ðŸš©:
