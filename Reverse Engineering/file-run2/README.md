## Name: file-run2
#### Points: 100
#### Description: Another program, but this time, it seems to want some input. What happens if you try to run it on the command line with input "Hello!"?
#### Files: `run`

This is essentially the same challenge as the previous `file-run` task, however, we need to pass the phrase "Hello!" when running the executable.
Adding this argument outputs the flag ðŸš©:
